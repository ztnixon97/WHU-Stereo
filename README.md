# WHU-Stereo
This repository contains:

I. A large-scale dataset named WHU-Stereo for stereo matching of high-resolution satellite imagery,

II. Several deep learning methods for stereo matching.

### Dataset
This work is done by the team of Prof. Wanshou Jiang in State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.

The dataset is available at:

i. 

ii. 

### Deep learning methods
The methods include:

i. "StereoNet: Guided Hierarchical Refinement for Real-Time Edge-Aware Refinement for Real-Time Edge-Aware" by Sameh Khamis, Sean Fanello, Christoph Rhemann, Adarsh Kowdle, Julien Valentin, and Shahram Izadi, in ECCV 2018.

ii. "Pyramid Stereo Matching Network" by Jia-Ren Chang and Yong-Sheng Chen, in CVPR 2018.

iii. "HMSM-Net: Hierarchical multi-scale matching network for disparity estimation of high-resolution satellite stereo images" by Sheng He, Shenhong Li, San Jiang, and Wanshou Jiang, in ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 2022.

Note that the code is completed by referring to the original open-source code and may be a little different from the original papers.

Development environment: CUDA 11.2, TensorFlow 2.5.0, Python 3.7.
